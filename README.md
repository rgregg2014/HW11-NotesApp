## Installation
  
To use the application on your local host server, ensure you have Node installed. Then, run `npm init` and `npm i express` to ensure you have the proper setup to fire up the server in your command line. Then, run `node server` in your terminal and follow the link printed to the console to start the application. The application is also available for use in-browser on Heroku at https://taking-notes-1206.herokuapp.com/
  
## Usage
  
Using either access method listed above, navigate to the landing page. Then, hit the "Get Started" button. On the next page, click on the plus button in the upper right hand corner to add a blank note. Add in a title and the text of your note and hit the save button to hang onto them. Currently, the delete buttons do not work. That functionality is on its way for user convenience!
